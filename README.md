## My process
- I first created a div element to put everything inside it. I thought about putting two more div elements inside it, for the top and 
bottom segments, but then I ditched the idea and for desktop screen, it just worked fine.
- Then I created an image element, a heading element and two paragraph elements
- Then I created an unordered list and styled all the items accordingly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learnt

I learnt how to add hovering effect by doing this challenge. Although it was an easy doing, but using it first time, I'm really feeling
like I've learnt something new.

```css
ul li:hover{
    background-color: greenyellow;
    color: black;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Cursor to Pointer when hovering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3087975/how-to-change-the-cursor-into-a-hand-when-a-user-hovers-over-a-list-item) - This helped me changing the cursor into hand when hovering on the list item.

## Improvements to be done

- The page is not responsive, it doesn't behave properly for small screen sizes. That I'll have to fix after learning about it.
